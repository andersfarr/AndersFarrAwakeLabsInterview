# AndersFarrAwakeLabsInterview

Dear Awake Labs Staff, I've had a great time working my way through this Wear Os App project. Feel free to have a look at the project files here.

I have based my DB implementation off of https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view-kotlin#13 and my Health Listener service client implementation off of https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/health/services/client/PassiveMonitoringClient and https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/health/services/client/PassiveListenerCallback.

I developed UI unit tests for the Interfaces but I did not have enough time to develop the full integration and unit tests that I wanted. I played with my emulator instance using https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/health-services/synthetic-data to get mock data. 

Anyways - I look forward to chatting about this!

Anders
